# Argument Ontology (ARGO)

Although the last decade has seen a proliferation of ontological approaches to
arguments, many of them employ ad hoc solutions to representing arguments, lack
interoperability with other ontologies, or cover arguments only as part of a broader approach to
evidence. To provide a better ontological representation of arguments, we present the Arguments
Ontology (ArgO), a small ontology for arguments that is designed to be imported and easily
extended by researchers who work in different upper-level ontology frameworks, different
logics, and different approaches to argument evaluation. ArgO utilizes Basic Formal Ontology
(BFO) as an upper-level ontology, and may be used alongside other commonly used ontologies
in the BFO framework, including both the Information Artifact Ontology (IAO) and the
Information Entity Ontology (INFO). Critically, our proposal is principled, based on rigorous
definitions and formal axioms out of which characterizations of arguments naturally fall. It is our
hope that ArgO may assist researchers in many projects, including: integrating heterogeneous
sources of evidence, structuring the content of semantic wikis, and enhancing semantic
reasoning.
